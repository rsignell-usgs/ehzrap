What would be the best way to get some bird migration data into TerriaJS?

Basically, this is basically a bunch of CSV files (one for each bird type), and each CSV file looks like this:

Flycatcher.csv:
"yearday","lon","lat"
1,-77.1685735208084,5.36328777248622
2,-77.1511228203405,5.38111171240858
3,-77.1315657168625,5.39856209286252
I looked at the CSV specification here https://github.com/NICTA/nationalmap/wiki/csv-geo-au but it seemed not designed for this type of data (even if I converted yearday to dates for a specific year).

Would CZML be the best bet?

@rsignell-usgs I guess it depends on what sort of visualization you're trying to create. I changed the CSV file above to:

date,lon,lat
2016-01-01,-77.1685735208084,5.36328777248622
2016-01-02,-77.1511228203405,5.38111171240858
2016-01-03,-77.1315657168625,5.39856209286252
And dropped it onto nationalmap.gov.au. It shows each point in the list until the time slider gets to the next time, at which time the point is shown at that location.

If you'd instead like to draw a line representing the path, and then smoothly animate a point along the line over time, CZML is a good way to do that. Here's what that would look like:

[{
    "id": "document",
    "name": "flycatcher",
    "version": "1.0",
    "clock": {
        "interval": "2016-01-01/2016-01-03",
        "currentTime": "2016-01-01",
        "multiplier": 21600.0,
        "range": "LOOP_STOP",
        "step": "SYSTEM_CLOCK_MULTIPLIER"
    }
}, {
    "id": "flycatcher",
    "availability":"2016-01-01/2016-01-03",
    "position": {
        "cartographicDegrees": [
            "2016-01-01", -77.1685735208084, 5.36328777248622, 0.0,
            "2016-01-02", -77.1511228203405, 5.38111171240858, 0.0,
            "2016-01-03", -77.1315657168625, 5.39856209286252, 0.0
        ]
    },
    "point": {
        "color": {
            "rgba": [
                0, 0, 255, 255
            ]
        },
        "outlineWidth": 0,
        "pixelSize": 10,
        "show": true
    },
    "path": {
        "show": true,
        "width": 1,
        "material": {
            "solidColor": {
                "color": {
                    "rgba": [
                        0, 0, 255, 255
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    }
}]
